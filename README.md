## Map View

The map view is populated with various options for food, beverage, or entertainment
which are a short walk from my home.    

On a desktop computer with the view taking the full screen, the map appears on the right side of the screen.

On a mobile phone, the map appears at the very bottom of the screen.

Between those two extremes, the app responds to the viewport dimensions and renders either a side by side
view with map on right, or a top to bottom single column view with the map on the bottom.

The map markers are clickable.  When you click on a marker, it changes style from 
the default pin to a start.   As description of the venue, as retieved from Foursquare
is displayed. 

## Star Marker Description

The selected marker is designed by a star.  Foursquare is contacted to get further information on
the venue.  The details and quantity of that further information depend on the results from the
Foursquare API, but can include: a category, street address, URL, and phone number.

## List View

The List View is a list of all the markers listed by venue name.  Clicking on a venue name in the 
list view results in a similar response to clicking on a marker.

## Search Box

There are sort may places nearby is is hard to see the forest from the trees.  The Search box can 
be used to search for a venue name.  As each character is typed, the marker and list of venues is
filters to show only those with the typed search string as part of their name.
